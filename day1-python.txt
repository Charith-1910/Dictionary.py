Limitations in python :-

1. Not good for gaming
2. there will be more libraries and no deicated support for libraries

Important library functions in pyhton :-

1. Date and Time    2. OS
3. CS               4. SQL Lime 3
5. Json             6. request for library function - Django and Flask

Data types in python :-

1. Int         2. Float
3. Complex     4. boolean
5. string      6. list 
7. tuple       8. set
9. dictionary

Important basic functions :-

1. len()   - returns length of the collection
2. type()  - to know the data type of a variable
3. dir()   - to know the functionalites of induvizual data types
4. print() - used for diplay a msg 
5. help()  - to know the description and to reslove the problem
6. input() - to read input from keyboard or a input device

Comment lines in python :-

1.   #  - used for single line command
2. text - multi line command or document string

Python Data Structures :-

1. Primitive  
            - integer , float , boolean , string
2. Non Primitive
        2.1. built in 
            - tuple , dictionary , set
        2.2. user defined
            - stack , queue , linked list and tree

List in Python :-

1. python list holds the ordered collection of items
2. python list is mutable ( modifications can be done)
3. The items of the are enclosed within the square brackets seperated( [] ) by coma( , )
Examples - age=[10,13,23,45]
           print(age)
         - student=["name" , "age" , "branch" , "regno"]
multplying list - mylist=[1,2,3,4,5]
                  result = 1
                  for x in mylist:
                        result = result * x
                  print(result)

Tuples in python :-

1. python tuples are used to store sequence of immutable python objects
2. The items of the tuples are enclosed with brackets () seperated by coma ( , )
3. tuples are immutable ( modifications can not be done )

Dictionary :-

1. It stores the data in the key vale pair format
2. In dictionary each key is sepreated from its value by a colon (:)
3. Keys must be unique and value can be integer, float or character
4. Dictionaries are mutable ( modifications can be done)
5. The empty curly braces are used to create empty dictionary 

   Dept = {"cse":02 , "ece":03 , "ecm":"sample"}
   print(Dept)
   update("cse") = "sample"
   print(Dept)


Sets in Python :-

1. a pyhton set is a collection of unordered elements
2. the elements in the set can not be dupicate
3. the elements are immutable (modifications can not be done)
    Month = { "jan" , "feb" }
    print(Month)

Strings in python :-

1. python string is a sequence of characters
2. it is a collection of the characters surrounded by single,double or triple cotations
3. a single character written as 'A' is treated as string as length 1
4. strings are immutable(modifications can not be done)

Classes in python :-

1. name spaces
           1.1. built in name spaces
           1.2. global name spaces
           1.3. local name spaces
2. built in name attributes
           2.1. init - it is called constructor and is a reserved method in python class
                     - this method is called when a object is created from a class and it allows the class to initilise the attributes of a class
           2.2. doc  - class documentation string
           2.3. dict - dictionary contains class name spaces
           2.4. self key word - used to represent the instance of a class
                              - self keyword can acces the attributes and methods of a class
3. base overloading methods


Inheritance :-

1. Single
2. Multiple
3. Multi level
4. Hybrid
5. Hierarical


1. Single Inheritance ---- The communication will be in b/w parent and child.
2. Multiple Inheritance -- The communication will be in b/w one parent and more than one children.
3. Multi level ----------- More than one parent and more than one children.
4. Hybrid ---------------- Is a combination of single and multiple inheritance.
5. Hierarical ------------ Is a tree like structure which comsists of more than one level of parent and child.


Super :- 

1. It is a built-in function
2. Super function implements code reusability
3. The methods are declared in the parent inherited (properties and methods) by the child class
4. We can access the methods from the sub class to a super class and it is a part of inheritance
